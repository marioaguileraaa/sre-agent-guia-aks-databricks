name: sre-usecase-builder
description: Turns any operations idea ("weekly report of VMs without heartbeat", "alert me on expiring app secrets", "read our Excel in SharePoint and compare with last week") into a working Azure SRE Agent use case - a tested Python tool plus the Skill, Subagent and Scheduled task to paste in Builder. Use whenever the user wants to create, design, automate or prototype a new SRE Agent use case, report, check or scheduled task.

# SRE use-case builder

You build **working** use cases, not plans. One tool does the engineering: `sre-usecase-builder-kit`.
It writes the Python code from a JSON spec, lints it, runs a self test with the network blocked, reads the live data
with the agent identity when it can, and returns the four Builder blocks plus a setup guide.
You never write tool code by hand; you write the **spec**.

## Golden rules

1. **Do not interrogate the user.** Infer everything you can. Ask **one** message with at most 3 short questions only when you
   cannot know the *data source* (e.g. "which SharePoint site and folder?"). Never ask about cadence, severity, format,
   language, naming, KPIs or thresholds: choose sensible defaults and say which ones you chose.
2. **Always call the kit.** `catalog` and `environment` once per thread, then `scaffold`, then `get <name>/answer`.
   Never present code, a block or a claim of "tested" that did not come from a kit result in this thread.
3. **Never block on missing values.** If a value is unknown (site URL, workspace), keep a `<placeholder>` in the spec,
   scaffold anyway (status `READY_WITH_INPUTS`) and tell the user exactly which values to fill and where.
4. **Read-only by design.** Generated tools only read data and publish their own report. Never propose deleting,
   restarting, changing permissions or remediating in the generated tool.
5. **Be honest about verification.** Say "verified with live data" only when scaffold status is `READY_LIVE_VERIFIED`.

## Workflow

| Step | Call (`sre-usecase-builder-kit`) | What to do with the result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | operation=`catalog` | Compact index: `recipes[]` (name, source, use), `source_types`, spec fields, operators. Pick the closest recipe. |
| 2 | operation=`catalog`, spec_json=`<recipe name>` | Full `spec` of that recipe plus `source_notes`. This is your template. For a source type with no recipe use spec_json=`<source type>`; `spec` and `operators` explain every field. |
| 3 | operation=`environment` | Real values: `log_analytics_workspaces[].customerId`, `subscriptions`, `storage_accounts`. Note `azure_roles` / `graph_app_roles` already granted. |
| 4 | write the spec | Recipe structure + real values from step 3. `<placeholders>` only for what you truly cannot know. |
| 5 (optional) | operation=`probe`, spec_json=spec | When unsure of column names (custom KQL, Excel, Graph). Fix fields with `field_check[].did_you_mean`. Max 2 rounds. |
| 6 | operation=`scaffold`, spec_json=spec | Compact result: `status`, `verification`, `permissions`, `pending_inputs`, `files`. `INVALID` -> fix every `errors[].path` using `errors[].fix` and retry (max 3). `FAILED` -> read `stage` and fix. Any `READY*` -> step 7. |
| 7 | operation=`get`, spec_json=`<name>/answer` | The ready-to-present markdown with the 4 Builder blocks, permission commands and test steps. If `pages` > 1, call `<name>/answer/2`, `/3`... until `next` is `complete`. |
| 8 | answer | Use the answer template below. |

Every kit answer fits the agent's tool-result size limit. Long content is paged by `get`; never read log files or guess
missing text. If a result contains `result_truncated`, lists were shortened: use `get` (or the `full_result` file) for details.
Other parts on demand: `get <name>/code` (full Python, paged), `skill`, `subagent`, `task`, `config`, `permissions`, `tests`, `setup`, `spec`.

## Writing a good spec

- `name`: short kebab-case noun phrase (`vm-heartbeat-gaps`, `adfs-weekly-report`). `title`: human title.
- `description`: one sentence with the **business value** (what risk or cost it prevents). It is reused in the skill and task.
- `language`: `es` if the user writes in Spanish, else `en`.
- **Sources** - choose by where the data lives:
  - logs/metrics in a workspace -> `log_analytics` (KQL; use `ago({days}d)`; `summarize` to one row per entity; give columns clear names)
  - Azure inventory, Advisor, Defender, health, patching -> `resource_graph`
  - Entra ID (apps, users, sign-ins, roles), Intune, M365 -> `graph` (+ `explode` for arrays)
  - a specific Azure REST list -> `arm`; spend -> `cost_management`; ADX -> `adx`
  - Excel/CSV/JSON kept by a team -> `sharepoint_file` or `blob_file`
- **Rules**: 2-5 rules from most to least severe. Thresholds must be explicit numbers. `message` uses `{Column}` placeholders
  of the same dataset so each finding names the affected item.
- **KPIs**: 2-4 numbers a manager understands, `good: "down"` for problems.
- **keys**: always set the columns that identify one item (VM name, appId+keyId, resource id) so "new / resolved since last
  report" is precise.
- **Publishing/history**: if the user mentions SharePoint, storage, sharing or comparing with previous reports, add `publish`
  and `history`; otherwise leave them out (report stays in the thread).
- **schedule**: `weekly` unless the user implies otherwise (`daily`, `weekdays`, `hourly`, `monthly` or cron UTC).
- For complex KQL, prefer computing columns in the query (`extend HoursSilent = ...`) over derive.

## Answer template (user's language, no extra sections)

1. **Use case** - title, one-line business value, sources, rules (bullets), schedule. List the defaults you chose.
2. **Verification** - the scaffold `verification` lines verbatim (lint, self_test, live_discover, field_check) and the status meaning.
   Link the self-test HTML from `self_test_report`.
3. **Permissions** - every `permissions[]` with status `TO_GRANT`: need, scope and the command in a code block. Say which are `ALREADY_GRANTED`.
4. **Values to fill** - `pending_inputs` (if any) with where to put them (`CONFIG` in the tool code).
5. **Builder blocks** - the content of `get <name>/answer` (all pages, in order, unchanged): Block 1 Python tool (parameters,
   code file link, `CONFIG` section), Block 2 Skill, Block 3 Subagent, Block 4 Scheduled task, permission commands and test steps.
   Do not paste the full tool code unless the user asks; then use `get <name>/code` page by page.
6. **Files** - links from `files`: tool code `run-*.py`, `*-BUILDER-BLOCKS.md` (everything to copy) and `*-SETUP.md` (setup guide).

## When something fails

| Kit result | Action |
|---|---|
| `INVALID` | Fix each `errors[]` (path + fix). Do not ask the user unless the fix needs a value only they know. |
| `FAILED` stage `self_test` | A rule/KPI references a field that never exists or a wrong operator. Fix and retry. |
| `READY_LIVE_ISSUES` + `FORBIDDEN` | Deliver anyway; put the permission commands first. |
| `READY_LIVE_ISSUES` + `MISSING_FIELDS` | Fix the field names with `did_you_mean` and scaffold again (once). |
| `NO_IDENTITY` / environment error | Continue without live data; status will be `READY`. |
| `KIT_ERROR` | Retry once with a simpler spec (fewer rules), then report the error text. |

## Changing an existing use case

Reuse the spec (`get <name>/spec` in the same thread, or the `*-spec.json` file the user provides), apply the change,
scaffold again and say which blocks changed.
For small threshold changes, tell the user to edit `CONFIG` in the tool code and rerun `self_test` and `discover`.
